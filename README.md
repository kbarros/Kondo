What it does
------------

This code builds upon the [FastKPM](https://github.com/kbarros/FastKPM) library to enable fast, linear-scaling simulations of the classical Kondo lattice model (KLM).

The model contains itinerant electrons, whose spins couple to _classical_ magnetic moments localized on each site. After "integrating out" the itinerant electrons, the effective interactions between magnetic moments can be long-range and many-body. For example, at weak coupling `J`, the effective interactions are of the [RKKY type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKKY_interaction). This code allows arbitrary `J`, and treats long-range interactions correctly.

With GPU acceleration enabled, this code readily enables simulating the dynamics of 10k interacting magnetic moments, or even more.

Building
--------

Building is handled with CMake.

The [FastKPM](https://github.com/kbarros/FastKPM) library should already be compiled and installed. Kondo will then automatically link to it.

This package includes tests. Please start with `bin/test_kpm` and `bin/test_kondo` to make sure everything is installed correctly.

Usage
-----

Still needs to be documented...

Applications
------------

An early version of this method was presented in:
* [_Efficient Langevin simulation of coupled classical fields and fermions_](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.235101), Barros et al., PRB (2013).

However, the method has evolved significantly since then! Two important improvements are [gradient-based probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10570) and [more accurate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1801) integration of the magnetic dynamics.

This code has been used in the following research papers:
* [_Exotic magnetic orderings in the kagome Kondo-lattice model_](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.245119), Barros et al., PRB (2014)
